Johnathan A. Doe is a 58-year-old male with an extensive history of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and musculoskeletal complaints. He presents with a two-week history of exertional chest pain described as a squeezing, pressure-like sensation that radiates to his left arm and occasionally to the jaw.

Hospital Course and Consultations:
------------------------------------------------------------
Admission Date: 11/10/2023
Reason for Admission:  
  Evaluation of worsening exertional chest pain and dyspnea; rule out acute ischemic events; optimize management of multiple chronic conditions.

Hospital Course:
  • Patient admitted to the telemetry unit for continuous cardiac monitoring.
  • Initial management included adjustment of beta-blocker therapy and initiation of sublingual nitroglycerin for acute episodes.
  • Serial cardiac enzymes were drawn; Troponin levels remained within acceptable limits.
  • A comprehensive stress test revealed moderate ischemia, prompting further cardiologic evaluation.
  • Blood pressure and glucose levels were closely monitored, with minor medication adjustments made during the stay.
  • Pain management for osteoarthritis was optimized with scheduled NSAIDs and physical therapy consultation.
  • The patient’s renal function and electrolyte balance were monitored given his stage 2 CKD.

Consultations:
  Cardiology – Advised further non-invasive imaging (coronary CT angiography) and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if symptoms persist.
  Endocrinology – Reviewed diabetic regimen; recommended dietary modifications and potential addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor.
  Nephrology – Recommended continued monitoring of renal function with follow-up every 6 months.
  Urology – Evaluated BPH symptoms; advised conservative management with Tamsulosin and lifestyle modifications.
  Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation – Consulted for osteoarthritis management; initiated physical therapy referral.

------------------------------------------------------------
Assessment and Plan:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):
  • Continue current management; consider increasing beta-blocker dosage.
  • Schedule coronary CT angiography for further evaluation.
  • Monitor cardiac biomarkers; consider PCI if recurrent symptoms occur.
2. Hypertension:
  • Reinforce lifestyle modifications; ensure strict medication adherence.
  • Monitor BP closely and adjust antihypertensive regimen as needed.
3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:
  • Tighten glycemic control; adjust Metformin dosing and consider adjunctive therapy.
  • Emphasize dietary modifications and regular blood glucose monitoring.
4. Hyperlipidemia:
  • Continue statin therapy; reassess lipid profile in follow-up.
  • Consider adding ezetimibe if LDL remains elevated.
5. GERD:
  • Continue Omeprazole; reassess symptoms at outpatient follow-up.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage 2):
  • Monitor renal function (BUN, creatinine) every 3–6 months.
  • Advise hydration and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents.
7. Osteoarthritis:
  • Continue NSAIDs as needed; engage in physical therapy for joint strengthening.
  • Evaluate for possible joint injection therapy if pain persists.
8. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):
  • Continue Tamsulosin; monitor urinary symptoms; consider urology referral if worsening.
9. Sleep Apnea:
  • Continue CPAP therapy; periodic reassessment with sleep studies recommended.

Plan:
  • Initiate discharge planning with detailed outpatient follow-up instructions.
  • Home-based cardiac rehabilitation program to be started upon discharge.
  • Reinforce strict dietary modifications and exercise regimen tailored to current limitations.
  • Educate patient on recognizing signs of acute chest pain and the importance of seeking immediate care.
  • Schedule follow-up appointments with Cardiology, Endocrinology, Nephrology, and Primary Care.
