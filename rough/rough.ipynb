He was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia in 2008 and is on statin therapy. He had a myocardial infarction in 2018, after which he underwent angioplasty with stent placement. His GERD, diagnosed in 2012, is managed with a daily proton pump inhibitor. His OSA, diagnosed in 2019, is treated with CPAP therapy. His chronic kidney disease was identified in 2017 and is under regular monitoring. His BPH, diagnosed in 2015, is managed with alpha-blockers. His osteoarthritis, diagnosed in 2011, primarily affects his knees and lumbar spine. He had a past episode of hyperthyroidism in 2002, which was resolved with medical management.\n",
